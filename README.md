# bogeyman

A header-only C/C++ framework for unit tests and assertions.

Configured by default to print assertion file and code line and abort on any assertion.  
If you want a different behavior, take a look at [options.hpp](inc/bogeyman/options.hpp): you can change behavior by defining macros before including *bogeyman.assert.hpp*.
